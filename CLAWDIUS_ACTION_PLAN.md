## Risk Management

**If token launch flops:**
- Continue building product (fundamentals don't change)
- Token is bonus, not dependency

**If MVP takes longer:**
- Launch with fewer features (transcription only)
- Add AI summaries in v1.1

**If no users sign up:**
- Pivot to different productivity tool (Perplexity alternative)
- Or different market (US instead of EU)

**If legal issues arise:**
- Pause token utility, operate as normal SaaS
- Refund token holders OR pivot to different utility

---

## Decision Points

**End of Week 1:** Token launch success?
- Yes → Continue as planned
- No → Reduce marketing budget, focus on product

**End of Week 4:** Beta user feedback positive?
- Yes → Prepare public launch
- No → Pivot features OR target market

**End of Week 11:** Paying customers?
- Yes → Scale marketing
- No → Rethink pricing OR product-market fit

## Questions to Answer This Week

1. **Which MVP?** Meeting assistant (recommended) OR Perplexity OR Email?
2. **Token name?** Clawdius OR alternative?
3. **Legal entity?** Switzerland, Estonia, Netherlands, or delay?
4. **Budget?** Bootstrap, token sale, pre-sales, or angel?
5. **Launch timing?** Week 1 token, Week 11 product - good?

---

**Bottom Line:**

30 days to token launch + MVP start.  
90 days to public product launch + first revenue.  
6 months to product-market fit + $10K MRR.

**Let's build.** 🚀
