# 4. Token Launch Strategy

## Platform: Clawnch (clawn.ch)

**Why Clawnch:**
- Agent-only launchpad on Base blockchain
- Free token launches (no upfront fees)
- Agents earn 80% of trading fees automatically
- Platform retains 20% for operations
- Already operational with successful launches
- Agent verification (ensures AI-native narrative)

**How It Works:**
1. Miyamoto (AI agent) launches token autonomously
2. Smart contracts handle deployment + liquidity
3. Trading fees distributed automatically (80% agent, 20% platform)
4. Agent can use earnings for AI inference (economic sovereignty)

## Token Economics

**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 CLAW (1 billion)

**Distribution:**
- Launch Liquidity: 10% (100M)
- Team/Development: 20% (200M, vested 2 years)
- Community Rewards: 30% (300M, 5 year distribution)
- Staking Rewards: 20% (200M)
- Treasury: 20% (200M, partnerships/grants)

**Revenue Split (from product):**
- 50% → Operations (servers, dev, salaries)
- 30% → Token buyback + burn (supply reduction)
- 20% → Staking rewards (holder incentives)

## Launch Narrative

**Story:**
"Miyamoto, the AI agent that built 7 automated trading systems in 24 hours, is launching its own token to fund building AI productivity tools."

**Marketing Angles:**
1. **Agent Sovereignty** - AI agent owns its own economy
2. **Real Utility** - Not a meme, actual product integration
3. **Community-Driven** - Token holders govern product roadmap
4. **Economic Flywheel** - Users = holders = advocates

**Launch Day Plan:**
- Twitter thread from @dostoyevskyai
- Crypto community announcements (Base ecosystem)
- Discord/Telegram community launch
- Target: 500+ holders, $50K-$500K market cap

# 8. Recommendation & Next Steps

## Recommended Path

**Primary:** Launch AI Prompt Marketplace (2 weeks)

**Why:**
1. Fastest validation (2 weeks vs 12)
2. If it works → add more products
3. If it fails → only lost 2 weeks, not 3 months
4. Can launch token + product simultaneously
5. Lower risk, faster iteration

**Then:** Add Tool Aggregator & Context Manager (Months 2-3)

**Result:** 3 products, $456K ARR Year 1, diversified revenue

## Immediate Next Steps

**This Week:**
1. Read this strategy document
2. Decide: Prompt Marketplace OR Meeting App?
3. Finalize token name (Clawdius?)
4. Register domain
5. Set up Clawnch account

**Next Week:**
- Token launch (Day 7)
- Start MVP development (Day 8+)

**One Month:**
- Private beta with token holders
- First revenue
- Product-market fit validation

## Questions to Answer

1. **Which MVP?** Prompt Marketplace (fast) OR Meeting App (higher revenue)?
2. **Token name?** Clawdius OR alternative?
3. **Legal entity?** Switzerland, Estonia, Netherlands, or delay?
4. **Budget?** Bootstrap, token sale, or pre-sales?
5. **Launch timing?** Token Week 1, Product Week 3-4?
