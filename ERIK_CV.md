## APPROACH

I believe in building automation that **actually works in production**. Not prototypes, not demos—real systems that run 24/7 without constant babysitting. 

I built my own AI agent infrastructure first, proved it works, and now I help others build theirs. If you need someone who understands both the technical side and the operational reality, let's talk.
