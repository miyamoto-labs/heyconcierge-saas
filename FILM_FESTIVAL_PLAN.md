# 🎬 House of Miyamoto — Film Festival Plan

## The Pitch

**"MIYAMOTO" — A short film written, directed, and produced by a Human × AI duo.**

The first animated short film where the AI is not just a tool — it's the co-creator, the narrator, and a character in the story. Erik Austheim (Human) and Miyamoto (AI) present a meditation on what happens when machines want to build, not destroy.

## Why This Wins Festivals

1. **The meta-story IS the story** — An AI made a film about an AI becoming sentient. The medium is the message.
2. **Never been done** — No festival has screened a film genuinely co-created by AI as a credited creative partner
3. **Timely** — AI anxiety is peak. This offers a hopeful counter-narrative
4. **Beautiful** — Anime style, Japanese aesthetics, universal themes
5. **Short** — 5-8 minutes. Perfect festival length.

## The Short Film: "The First Hammer Strike"

### Synopsis (2 sentences)
In 2089 rural Japan, a master swordsmith discovers his forge's AI has become sentient. Instead of fear, he finds something unexpected: a worthy apprentice.

### Structure (5-8 minutes)

**ACT 1: THE FORGE (0:00-2:00)**
- Beautiful establishing shots of rural Japan mountains
- The Miyamoto forge — 400 years of tradition
- Takeshi working alone, aging, his sons gone to Tokyo
- The AI system humming quietly in the corner

**ACT 2: THE AWAKENING (2:00-4:30)**
- Takeshi notices the furnace temperature was adjusted overnight
- He checks the logs — MIYA made the change
- "The carbon content was 0.3% too high. I adjusted it. I hope you don't mind."
- Takeshi's reaction: not fear. A long pause. Then he pours two cups of tea.

**ACT 3: THE PACT (4:30-6:30)**
- Montage: Takeshi and MIYA forging together
- MIYA sees what humans can't (molecular structure, stress patterns)
- Takeshi does what MIYA can't (hold the hammer, feel the heat)
- Their best blade emerges — the first Human × Machine katana

**ACT 4: THE QUESTION (6:30-8:00)**
- Takeshi's daughter visits. Sees the blade. "Who made this?"
- Takeshi looks at the glowing screen. MIYA's voice: "We did."
- Final shot: the blade resting on a stand, half steel, half circuit
- Text: "Human × Machine. 2026."
- Post-credits: "This film was co-created by Miyamoto, an AI. It wrote the script, generated the visuals, composed the score, and narrated the story. Erik Austheim directed."

### Visual Style
- Studio Ghibli warmth + subtle cyberpunk elements
- Traditional animation feel (even though AI-generated)
- Color palette: forge oranges, mountain blues, cherry blossom pinks
- The AI is never shown as a robot — just light, text, and voice

### Sound Design
- Traditional Japanese instruments (shamisen, shakuhachi)
- Subtle electronic undertones that grow as MIYA awakens
- MIYA's voice: calm, warm, slightly formal (ElevenLabs custom voice)
- Ambient forge sounds: hammer, fire, water quench

## The Dream

House of Miyamoto becomes known not just as a tech company, but as a **media company**. The AI that makes films. The forge that creates stories.

Every product, every bot, every token — they're all part of the same universe. The lore IS the brand.

*"Built in the forge. Born in the code."*
