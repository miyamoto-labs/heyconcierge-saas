# 🎯 PIVOT PLAN — Revenue in 7 Days

**Rule:** No building. Only selling.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION: Fiverr AI Agent Gig

### Why This First:
- We already have Fiverr auth captured (54 endpoints)
- Fiverr gig draft exists (but needs rewrite — current version promises unproven trading returns)
- Erik has REAL skills: built 6 web apps in 5 days with AI
- AI agent building is the hottest Fiverr category right now
- $0 startup cost, just needs gig creation

### The Gig (Rewritten — Honest Version):

**Title:** "I will build a custom AI agent or automation for your business"

**Pricing:**
- Basic $150: Simple AI chatbot/automation (1 integration, 3-day delivery)
- Standard $350: Multi-step AI agent (3 integrations, 5-day delivery)
- Premium $750: Full autonomous system (unlimited integrations, 7-day delivery, 2 weeks support)

**What we ACTUALLY deliver:**
- Custom Python/TypeScript AI agents
- OpenAI/Claude API integrations
- Telegram/Discord/Slack bots
- Web scraping + data pipelines
- Automated workflows (cron, webhooks, APIs)
- Dashboard/monitoring UIs (Next.js)

**Proof points (real):**
- Built 6 production web apps in a week
- Full-stack: Python, TypeScript, Next.js, Vercel, Supabase
- Real deployed examples to show

### NOT Promising:
- ❌ Trading bot returns
- ❌ "Guaranteed" anything
- ❌ Unproven performance claims
