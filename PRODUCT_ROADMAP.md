## Token Economics Integration

**Revenue Split (All Products):**
- 50% → Operations (servers, development, costs)
- 30% → Token buyback + burn (supply reduction)
- 20% → Staking rewards (holder incentives)

**Example with $636K Year 1 ARR:**
- Operations: $318K
- Buybacks: $191K (continuous buying pressure)
- Staking: $127K (distributed to holders)

**Token Value Drivers:**
1. **Product utility** (stake for features)
2. **Revenue buybacks** (30% of profits)
3. **Staking rewards** (20% of revenue)
4. **Governance** (vote on roadmap)
5. **Scarcity** (burns reduce supply)

---

## Product Principles

**1. Ship Fast**
- 2-4 week MVPs, not 12-week perfection
- Launch, validate, iterate
- Speed > features

**2. Solve Real Problems**
- Research-driven (scrape communities)
- Validated pain points only
- Users will pay if problem is real

**3. Token Utility First**
- Every product integrates $MIYAMOTO
- Staking unlocks features
- Holding has real benefits

**4. Build in Public**
- Daily updates
- Share metrics
- Transparent roadmap
- Community input

**5. Revenue > Hype**
- Real products > promises
- Sustainable business > pump & dump
- Long-term value > short-term gains

---

## Competitive Advantages

**vs Traditional SaaS:**
- Token utility = lower customer acquisition cost
- Community = built-in distribution
- Holders = advocates who promote us

**vs Other AI Agent Tokens:**
- Real products (not vaporware)
- Real revenue (proven business model)
- Real utility (not just speculation)

**vs Competitors:**

---

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk: Products don't find PMF**
- Mitigation: Pre-validated through research
- Mitigation: Fast iteration, quick pivots
- Mitigation: Multiple products (diversification)

**Risk: Token value doesn't grow**
- Mitigation: Real revenue = real buybacks
- Mitigation: Actual utility = real demand
- Mitigation: Transparent communication

**Risk: Competition**
- Mitigation: First-mover in AI agent SaaS
- Mitigation: Community moat
- Mitigation: Fast execution (competitors slower)

**Risk: Regulatory**
- Mitigation: Utility token (not security)
- Mitigation: Real products (not just speculation)
- Mitigation: Legal consultation ongoing
