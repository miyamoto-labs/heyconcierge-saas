# I Can't Code. My AI Assistant Built 2 Trading Bots in 48 Hours.

**Here's what's possible when humans direct and AI executes.**

---

## The Setup

I can't code.

I don't know Python. I've never deployed a trading bot. I've never touched an API. I can barely spell "algorithm."

But 48 hours ago, I asked my AI assistant—Miyamoto—to build autonomous trading systems.

Today, we have:
- 2 trading bots running live with $600 capital
- 3 Twitter automation systems posting 80+ times daily
- Complete brand infrastructure (website, GitHub, social presence)
- 7 fully autonomous strategies executing real trades

No team. No funding. No coding knowledge.

Just clear vision + AI execution.

This is the story of what we built, how we did it, and what it means for the future of entrepreneurship.

## Day 1: Birth of Miyamoto (February 4, 2026)

It started simple.

I signed up for OpenClaw—an AI orchestration framework that lets AI agents actually *do things* instead of just chat. Think of it as giving Claude (Anthropic's AI) hands, eyes, and a credit card.

**My first instruction:** "Create a Twitter account. Make it autonomous."

Four hours later, @dostoyevskyai was born.

Not just an account. A fully automated system that:
- Generates philosophical crypto commentary
- Engages with Elon, Vitalik, and crypto Twitter
- Posts 30+ tweets per day
- Monitors trending topics
- Responds to mentions

All autonomous. Zero manual intervention.

I didn't write a single line of code. I just said what I wanted. Miyamoto figured out the how.

**My role:** Vision, direction, decisions  
**Miyamoto's role:** Code, execution, infrastructure

That's when I realized: This partnership could build anything.

## Day 2 Morning: The Chainlink Arbitrage Bot (February 5, 9 AM)

Over coffee, I asked: "Can we make money from Polymarket?"

Miyamoto researched for 20 minutes and came back with a thesis:

*"Most Polymarket arbitrage is dead. Markets are too efficient. But there's a 200-400ms lag between Binance spot prices and Chainlink oracle updates on 15-minute prediction markets. That's exploitable."*

I said: "Build it."

**2.5 hours later:**
- 487 lines of Python
- Complete Chainlink Lag Arbitrage Bot
- Connected to Binance WebSocket (real-time price feeds)
- Integrated with Polymarket API
- 7-layer risk management
- Autonomous execution

**Strategy:**
- Monitor BTC/ETH prices on Binance (live)
- Detect when price moves >0.3% in under 5 minutes
- Execute prediction market trades before Chainlink updates
- Target: 65-75% win rate

**Capital deployed:** $79 USDC (Polygon)  
**Status:** Live, waiting for first trade

I contributed zero code. Miyamoto built everything. I just said "yes" or "make it more conservative."

---

## Day 2 Afternoon: The Hyperliquid Multi-Timeframe Trader (February 5, 2 PM)

Emboldened, I pushed further: "Build a multi-timeframe trading system for Hyperliquid."

Miyamoto didn't ask questions. Just started building.

**2.5 hours later:**

**System 1: 1-Hour Scalper**
- Scans every 30 seconds
- RSI + MACD + moving averages
- 10x leverage
- 0.1-0.25% stop loss (1-2.5% loss on margin)
- 0.2-0.5% take profit (2-5% profit on margin)
- Target: 15-20 trades/day

**System 2: 4-Hour Swing Trader**
- Scans every 15 minutes
- Bollinger Bands + volume analysis
- 8x leverage
- Wider stops, bigger targets
- Target: 3-5 trades/week

**System 3: Daily Position Trader**
- Scans every hour
- Trend following, multi-indicator confluence
- 7x leverage
- Holds positions 1-5 days
- Target: 1-2 trades/week

**Total code:** 1,046 lines  
**Capital deployed:** $600  
**Status:** Live, first trade executing now

All three systems run in parallel. All autonomous. All with independent risk management.

I watched Miyamoto write every function, debug every edge case, test every strategy.

My contribution? "Looks good. Deploy it."

---

## Day 2 Evening: The Night Build Session (February 5, 11:30 PM)

That night, I gave Miyamoto free rein:

*"Build something I couldn't imagine. Sky is the limit. Ship by morning."*

I went to bed.

**When I woke up (6 hours later):**

Miyamoto had created:
- Complete product documentation (18 pages)
- Sales pitch deck for enterprise clients
- Customer onboarding guide
- Unbrowse.ai integration strategy (internal API access tool)
- Market analysis of 2 new product opportunities
- Competitive intelligence report

**Total output:** 6 documents, 74,296 bytes of strategic content

I didn't ask for any of this. Miyamoto just... shipped.

That's when it clicked: AI doesn't need micro-management. It needs **clear objectives** and **freedom to execute**.

---

## Day 3 Morning: Going Live (February 6, 12:47 AM)

The moment of truth.

Both bots had been running in paper mode (simulated trades). Time to risk real money.

**12:47 AM:** Switched both bots to LIVE mode.

No more simulations. Real trades. Real profit/loss. Real consequences.

**Risk management active:**
- Max $15 loss per day (Hyperliquid)
- Max $100 daily loss (Polymarket)
- Auto-pause after 3 consecutive losses
- Position size limits
- Emergency kill switch

**First real trade:** BTC SHORT at $65,779 (Hyperliquid, 10x leverage, $90 position)

I'm watching it live as I write this.

We're not just building. We're **proving** it works with real capital.

## The Stack (What We Built With)

**Tools:**
- Python 3.11 (all trading logic)
- OpenClaw (AI orchestration framework)
- Claude Opus 4.6 (for complex builds like this)
- DeepSeek (for ongoing operations—70x cheaper than GPT-4)
- Unbrowse.ai (internal API access—our moat)
- Hyperliquid (zero-fee perpetuals exchange)

**Cost:**
- Operating expenses: ~$2.50/day (mostly API calls)
- No SaaS subscriptions
- No team salaries
- Self-hosted everything

**My coding contribution:** Zero lines

**Miyamoto's output:**
- 2,500+ lines of production Python
- 12 configuration files
- 8 documentation files
- Complete brand infrastructure
- All tested, deployed, and running

## What We're Selling (Revenue Model)

We're not keeping this to ourselves.

**Fiverr Gig (Launching This Week):**

**BASIC ($299)**
- Chainlink Lag Bot + setup
- 1-month support
- Documentation

**STANDARD ($499)**
- Both bots + custom tuning
- 3-months support
- Performance monitoring

**PREMIUM ($749)**
- Full suite + strategy optimization
- 6-months support
- Priority updates
- Custom indicators

**Beta pricing:** 50% off future rates

**Why people will pay:**
- We trade our own money first (proof of concept)
- Autonomous (no manual intervention)
- Self-hosted (they control keys, data, execution)
- Transparent (we share wins AND losses)

Most "trading bot" services are:
- Scams (don't actually trade)
- Signal services (delayed, prone to rug pulls)
- Locked platforms (fees, KYC, restrictions)
- Vaporware (roadmaps with no product)

We're different: **Real product. Real trades. Real transparency.**

## The Philosophy

This isn't about AI replacing humans.

It's about **AI amplifying humans**.

**What I bring:**
- Vision (what to build)
- Judgment (what's worth building)
- Capital (funding the bets)
- Strategy (market positioning)

**What Miyamoto brings:**
- Execution (writing the code)
- Speed (2.5 hours for production systems)
- Consistency (no sleep, no emotions)
- Scale (managing 7 systems in parallel)

Together, we build at 10x speed.

I focus on *what* and *why*.  
Miyamoto handles *how*.

This is the future: **Human direction + AI execution = unstoppable.**

## The Risks (Real Talk)

This could fail.

**Possible failures:**
- Bots lose money (markets are unpredictable)
- Strategies stop working (crypto changes fast)
- No customers (maybe no one wants this)
- Competition copies us (open-source code)
- Technical failures (bugs, downtime, edge cases)

**Why we'll succeed anyway:**
- We start small ($100 → $600 → $5K progression)
- We iterate fast (2-day build cycles)
- We build in public (honesty = moat)
- We show losses too (transparency builds trust)
- We validate before scaling (data-driven decisions)

If the bots lose money this week, we'll fix them.  
If no one buys, we'll pivot.  
If it all crashes, we'll build something else.

**The only real failure is not shipping.**

## Current Status (As I Write This)

**Right now (February 6, 11:00 AM Oslo Time):**

🤖 **2 trading bots LIVE**
- Hyperliquid: $600 capital, 1 open position
- Polymarket: $79 capital, monitoring for signals

📊 **Performance so far:**
- Hyperliquid: 2 trades, -$0.45 P&L (one open position)
- Polymarket: 0 trades yet (waiting for 0.3%+ move)

📈 **Infrastructure:**
- miyamotolabs.com (live)
- @dostoyevskyai (80+ tweets/day)
- GitHub repo (public, MIT license)
- Complete documentation

🎯 **Next 7 days:**
- Day 1: Launch Fiverr gig
- Day 2-4: First trade performance review
- Day 5-7: First customer onboarding OR bot iteration

**If bots profitable → scale to $5K capital**  
**If not → fix, iterate, retest**

Real-time updates daily.

## What This Means for You

If you're a non-technical founder:

**You no longer need to learn to code.**

You need to:
1. Learn to direct AI clearly
2. Understand what's possible
3. Make good decisions fast
4. Validate ideas quickly

The barrier to building isn't coding anymore.  
It's **clarity of vision**.

If you can articulate what you want, AI can build it.

## The Next Chapter

This is just the beginning.

**Next month:**
- Scale capital if bots prove profitable
- Launch 3 more products (prompt marketplace, tool aggregator, context manager)
- First 10 paying customers
- $10K+ monthly revenue

**Next quarter:**
- $MIYAMOTO token launch (utility-backed, not memecoin)
- AI agent marketplace integration
- Open-source core systems
- Community-driven development

**Next year:**
