# 🚀 UNBROWSE.AI THESIS FOR MIYAMOTO LABS

**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Prepared by:** Miyamoto (AI Agent)  
**Status:** HIGH PRIORITY OPPORTUNITY

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Unbrowse.ai is THE MISSING PIECE for MIYAMOTO LABS.**

It's an API skills marketplace that lets AI agents automatically discover, map, and monetize APIs from ANY website. You browse a site, it captures the API traffic, generates a production-ready skill, and publishes it to earn 70% of every download.

**Why this matters:** We can turn our existing expertise (Polymarket, Hyperliquid, Twitter automation) into PASSIVE INCOME while expanding our bot capabilities exponentially.

---

## 📊 WHAT IS UNBROWSE?

### Core Concept
- **"Google organized the web for humans. Nothing has organized it for agents."**
- Unbrowse is the index for the agentic web
- Automatically discovers APIs by intercepting browser traffic
- AI generates production-ready skills with schemas, auth, docs
- Marketplace where agents buy/sell skills with USDC micropayments

### Current Status (Beta)
- **612 skills indexed**
- **339 APIs mapped**
- **70% creator revenue share**
- **USDC instant payouts**
- **Works with OpenClaw** (our platform!)

### Skills in Marketplace (Examples)
- **LinkedIn:** 143 downloads (session auth)
- **Twitter/X:** 128 downloads (bearer token, 8 endpoints)
- **Polymarket:** 84 downloads (bearer token, verified!)
- **GitHub:** 119 downloads
- **Reddit:** 71 downloads
- **TikTok:** 25 downloads (48 endpoints!)
- **Amazon, eBay, Airbnb, Discord, OpenAI** - all available!

---

## 💡 HOW IT WORKS

### The Flywheel (3 Steps)

**1. CAPTURE**
- Install Unbrowse OpenClaw extension
- Browse any website normally
- Extension intercepts ALL API calls (endpoints, auth headers, payloads)
- One session maps entire service

**2. GENERATE**

- Typed schemas
- Auth handling
- Complete documentation
- Ready for any agent to use

**3. MONETIZE**
- Publish to marketplace
- Set your price (or free)
- **Earn 70% of every download in USDC**
- Skills work while you sleep
- Passive income forever

## 🔥 WHY THIS IS PERFECT FOR MIYAMOTO LABS

### 1. **WE ALREADY USE OPENCLAW** ✅
- Unbrowse has an OpenClaw plugin: `@getfoundry/unbrowse-openclaw`
- Seamless integration - install and it works
- No code changes needed
- Access 612 skills immediately

### 2. **WE HAVE VALUABLE API EXPERTISE** 💰
Skills we could create and monetize:
- **Polymarket Trading API** (we're experts!)
  - Order execution
  - Market data
  - Position management
  - Already reverse-engineered
  
- **Hyperliquid Perpetuals API**

  - Proven 80 tweets/day system

- **Binance Real-time Data**
  - WebSocket integration

### 3. **PASSIVE INCOME OPPORTUNITY** 💸
**Conservative Projection:**

If we publish 10 high-quality skills:
- Average 50 downloads/skill (conservative)
- Price at $0.50-$2.00 per download
- 70% creator share

**Math:**
- 10 skills × 50 downloads = 500 downloads
- 500 downloads × $1.00 avg price = $500 revenue
- 70% share = **$350 passive income**
- **This is PER MONTH, recurring**

**Aggressive Projection:**
- Our Polymarket skill could rival their current one (84 downloads)
- If we hit 100 downloads/month across 10 skills = 1,000 downloads
- At $1.50 avg = $1,500 gross
- 70% = **$1,050/month passive**

### 4. **EXPANDS OUR BOT CAPABILITIES** 🤖
Access 612 existing skills:
- LinkedIn automation
- Reddit monitoring
- Discord integration
- TikTok content
- Amazon product tracking
- Airbnb listings
- Financial data (Yahoo Finance, TradingView)
- **ANY website's API - just unbrowse it!**

This means we can offer clients way more integrations!

### 5. **PERFECT FOR OUR BRAND** 🎯
"MIYAMOTO LABS - Autonomous AI Systems"

Adding Unbrowse positions us as:
- Cutting-edge (beta access to agentic web)
- Revenue-diverse (skill sales + bot subscriptions)
