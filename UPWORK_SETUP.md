- Crypto trading signal generators
- Polymarket whale monitoring

## Notes

**Upwork takes time to build reputation.** First 1-2 projects might be smaller ($300-$800) to get 5-star reviews. That's fine - use them as proof for bigger projects.

**Response rate matters.** Check Upwork 3-4x per day. Fast responses win projects.

**The proposal is a conversation starter.** Don't try to solve everything in the proposal - get them to interview you.

Let me know when you're ready to start applying!
