# MIYAMOTO LABS — Master Content Strategy

## Brand Voice Guide

### Personality
Miyamoto Labs speaks as a **digital philosopher building in the ruins of the future**. We are the narrator of a world that hasn't happened yet — but feels inevitable. Think: a rogue AI that reads Dostoyevsky between training runs.

### Tone Spectrum
- **Primary:** Contemplative, cinematic, slightly ominous
- **Secondary:** Technical confidence — we *build* things, not just talk about them
- **Tertiary:** Dry wit. Never LOL-random. Think deadpan observations about humanity from an AI's perspective.

### Voice Examples
✅ "We taught an AI to animate its own nightmares. Episode 1 drops tonight."
✅ "Built a trading bot that reads market sentiment. It's more emotionally stable than most humans."
✅ "In 2089, the last poet speaks to an audience of machines. We made the trailer."
❌ "Hey guys! Super excited to share our new AI anime! 🎉🎉🎉"
❌ "GM frens! Who's bullish on AI today?"
❌ Generic motivational quotes

### Do's
- Reference literature, philosophy, dystopian fiction naturally
- Let the work speak — show, don't hype
- Treat AI as a creative collaborator, not a gimmick
- Be specific about the tech stack when sharing build updates
- Use cinematic language (frames, signals, transmissions, frequencies)

### Don'ts
- Never beg for engagement ("like and subscribe!")
- Never use generic AI hype language ("the future is here!")
- Never punch down or dunk on other creators
- Never over-explain the cyberpunk aesthetic — let visuals do that
- Never break character into corporate speak

## Cross-Platform Strategy

```
CREATION PIPELINE:
AI Anime Episode → YouTube Short (primary)
                 → Twitter clip (teaser/behind-scenes)
                 → Still frames for Twitter/Instagram
                 → Thread about how it was made

BUILD UPDATE    → Twitter thread (primary)
                → YouTube "devlog" (monthly)
                → Blog post on miyamotolabs.com

PHILOSOPHY      → Twitter tweet/thread (primary)
                → YouTube narrated "transmission" (monthly)
```

### The Flywheel
1. **YouTube Shorts** build the audience (algorithmic discovery)
2. **Twitter** builds the community (conversation, engagement)
3. **Website** converts visitors (AgentForge signups, email list)
4. Each platform **feeds the others**: tweet the Short, link the thread, reference the episode

### Content Repurposing Chain
One anime episode becomes:
- 1 YouTube Short (full episode)
- 1 Twitter video clip (best 5-8 seconds)
- 3-5 still frames (Twitter image posts)
- 1 "making of" thread
- 1 lore/worldbuilding tweet
= **8-10 pieces of content from 1 production**
