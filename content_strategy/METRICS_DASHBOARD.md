## Growth Benchmarks (AI/Creative Niche on YouTube Shorts)

- **0-100 subs:** Expect 100-500 views/Short. Focus on consistency (3x/week minimum). Don't optimize — just ship.
- **100-500 subs:** Algorithm starts suggesting your content. One Short will randomly pop (1K-10K views). Study why.
- **500-1K subs:** Consistent 1K-5K views/Short. This is where monetization application happens (1K subs needed).
- **1K-5K subs:** You're in the game. Community forms. Collabs become possible. Long-form starts mattering.

**Key insight:** In the Shorts game, *one viral Short* can 10x your subscriber count overnight. Your job is to keep publishing so the algorithm has chances to pick you up. Volume + quality + hooks.
