## Thread Templates

### Thread 1: "The Pipeline" (how we make AI anime)

We make cyberpunk anime episodes for ~$1 each.

No animation studio. No budget. Just AI tools and a story worth telling.

Here's the exact pipeline → 🧵

[1/6] SCRIPT & STORYBOARD

### Thread 2: "Why AI Cinema" (philosophy)

AI didn't kill cinema. It just made it possible for one person with $10 to compete with studios.

Here's why that matters → 🧵

## Hashtag Strategy

### Primary (use 1-2 per post)
`#AIAnime` `#CyberpunkArt` `#AIArt` `#AIVideo`

### Secondary (rotate)
`#BuildInPublic` `#IndieCreator` `#AIFilmmaking` `#Cyberpunk` `#AIGenerated`

### Niche (for discovery)
`#StableDiffusion` `#AICreativity` `#AnimeCommunity` `#ShortFilm` `#IndieAnime`

### Branded

**Rule:** Max 3 hashtags per tweet. Usually 1-2. Hashtags go at the end or woven naturally into text. Never hashtag-spam.

## Communities & Accounts to Engage

### Must-Follow & Engage
- AI video creators (Runway, Pika, Kling power users)
- AI art accounts with 1K-50K followers (similar growth stage = mutual engagement)
- Cyberpunk aesthetic accounts
- Indie hacker / build-in-public community
- AI agent builders

### Search Terms to Monitor
- "AI anime" — engage with anyone making similar content
- "AI generated video" — be part of the conversation

- "build in public" + "AI" — our builder community
- "autonomous agents" — AgentForge's market

## YouTube → Twitter Leverage

When a new episode drops:

1. **T-1 day:** Tweet a still frame teaser: "Tomorrow. Episode [X]. [Atmospheric caption]."
2. **T-0 (drop time):** Tweet the best 5-8 second clip + "Full episode on YouTube" with link
3. **T+1 day:** Tweet a "making of" detail or lore expansion from that episode
4. **T+3 days:** Tweet the best single frame as a standalone image post (no YouTube mention — let it stand alone)

This gives you **4 tweets from every single episode** without feeling repetitive.

---

## Growth Tactics

1. **Engage before you post.** Spend 10 min replying to others before dropping your content. Algorithm rewards active accounts.
2. **First reply matters.** When someone big posts about AI art/video, be the first thoughtful reply. Not "great post!" — a genuine insight or question.
3. **Pin your best thread.** Always have your most impressive thread or video pinned. Update monthly.
4. **Cross-pollinate.** When a tweet does well, note why. Repeat the format. Double down on what resonates.
5. **DM strategy.** When someone engages consistently, DM them. Not to sell — to connect. "Hey, love your work on [X]. We're doing something similar at Miyamoto Labs."
