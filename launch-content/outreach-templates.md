## A) DM Template for Freelancers

**Subject:** Tool that might help you build AI agents faster

Hey [Name],

I came across your [Upwork/Fiverr] profile and noticed you're building AI agents for clients. Curious if you've run into the same friction I did—constantly rebuilding similar agent logic from scratch, struggling to explain architecture to non-technical clients, or spending hours on deployment configs.

I built AgentForge to solve this. It's a visual AI agent builder that lets you:
- Design agent workflows visually (no code required for prototyping)
- Export to production-ready Python/Docker containers
- Show clients what you're building in real-time

Free tier is pretty generous, and it might save you hours per project. Worth checking out if you're tired of reinventing the wheel.

Let me know if you try it—always curious what real builders think.

## B) DM Template for Agency Owners

**Subject:** Built something for AI automation agencies

Hey [Name],

I run an AI development shop and kept seeing the same bottleneck: junior devs spending days building agent scaffolding, clients not understanding what they're paying for until it's too late, and deployment being way harder than it should be.

So we built AgentForge—a visual AI agent builder that:
- Lets non-technical team members prototype agent workflows
- Generates production Python/Docker code automatically
- Makes client presentations way easier (live visual demos > technical docs)

It's not a toy—exports real code that your devs can extend. We've been using it internally and it's cut our agent development time by ~40%.

Free tier available, Pro is $29/mo. Might be worth trying on your next agent project:

Happy to jump on a quick call if you want to see it in action.

## C) Reply Template for Reddit/Forum Questions

### For "What's the best AI agent builder?" type questions:

I've tried most of the tools mentioned here. Here's what I'd add:

**AgentForge** (https://agent-builder-gamma.vercel.app) - Newer tool, but really solid. Visual builder + exports to actual Python/Docker code (not vendor lock-in like some platforms). Free tier is generous.

What sets it apart:
- You design visually but get real exportable code
- Not just another wrapper around LangChain—you own the output
- Good middle ground between no-code and full coding

Worth trying alongside CrewAI/LangFlow. Some people prefer the visual approach, especially if you need to show clients what you're building.

### For "How do I build AI agents?" type questions:

If you're just starting, I'd recommend trying a visual builder first to understand the concepts, then diving into code.

**AgentForge** (https://agent-builder-gamma.vercel.app) is good for this because:
- Visual interface helps you understand agent architecture
- Exports to Python so you can see how it works under the hood
- Free tier lets you experiment without commitment

Then once you get the concepts, you can either keep using the visual builder or dive into frameworks like LangChain/AutoGen.

The export-to-code feature is key—you're learning while building, not locked into a black box.

---

### For "No-code AI agent platforms?" type questions:

For true no-code with the option to go deeper, check out **AgentForge** (https://agent-builder-gamma.vercel.app).

What's different:
- Visual builder (no coding required)
- Exports to Python/Docker when you need production deployment
- Not locked into their platform—you own the generated code

Most "no-code" platforms lock you in. This one lets you graduate to real code when you're ready. Free tier is solid for learning/prototyping.

## D) Cold Email Template for Newsletters

**Subject:** Partnership idea: AI agent builder for [Newsletter Name] readers

Hi [Newsletter Owner],

I'm [Your Name], founder of AgentForge—a visual AI agent builder that exports to production Python/Docker code.

I've been reading [Newsletter Name] for a while and think your audience would find this genuinely useful. Here's why:

**The problem:** Most AI agent tools either require heavy coding (LangChain, AutoGen) or lock you into proprietary platforms (no code exports). Developers want visual tools for speed, but need real code for production.

**Our solution:** Visual builder + Python/Docker export. Design visually, deploy professionally. No vendor lock-in.

**Traction:**
- FREE tier available, Pro $29/mo
- Used by freelancers building for clients
- Agencies using it to speed up development
- Exports production-ready code (not toy demos)

**Partnership idea:**
- Sponsored mention in an upcoming newsletter
- Or: Guest post showing how to build a real agent visually then deploy
- Or: Exclusive promo code for your readers (20% off Pro for 3 months)

We're early but growing fast. Would love to get in front of your audience.

Available for a quick call this week if you're interested.

Best,
[Your Name]

### For agent builder discussions:

Built agents with most of these. @AgentForge (https://agent-builder-gamma.vercel.app) deserves a mention—visual builder that exports real Python/Docker code. Not locked in like other platforms. Free tier is solid. 🔧

### For "how to build agents" tweets:

Start visual, graduate to code.

AgentForge lets you design agents visually, then exports to Python/Docker when you need production deployment.

Free tier: https://agent-builder-gamma.vercel.app

Not locked in = you own the output 🔑

## F) LinkedIn Comment Template

### For posts about AI automation tools:

Great list! I'd add **AgentForge** to the mix—visual AI agent builder that exports to Python/Docker. 

What sets it apart: You design visually (fast prototyping) but get production-ready code (no vendor lock-in). Free tier available.

We've been using it at our agency and it's cut agent dev time significantly. Worth checking out: https://agent-builder-gamma.vercel.app
