## Description (Product Hunt Main Copy)

**Stop writing agent plumbing code. Start shipping.**

AgentForge is the fastest way to build and deploy multi-agent AI systems — no code, no config files, no infrastructure headaches.

### What you get:
🎨 **Visual drag-and-drop editor** — Connect LLM nodes, tool nodes, memory nodes, and decision logic  
📦 **5 production-ready templates**:
   - Customer Support Agent (handles FAQs, escalations, ticket creation)
   - Social Media Manager (schedules posts, replies to comments, analyzes engagement)
   - Email Automation Agent (personalized outreach, follow-ups, categorization)
   - Price Monitor Agent (tracks competitor prices, sends alerts)
   - Content Creator Agent (researches topics, writes drafts, optimizes SEO)

🔗 **Integrations** — APIs, databases, web scraping, Zapier, Slack, Discord  
🧠 **Memory & context** — Long-term memory, vector search, conversation history  
🚀 **One-click deploy** — From prototype to production in minutes  
📊 **Visual debugging** — See exactly what your agent is thinking at each step  
💾 **Export to code** — Outgrow the UI? Export to Python/TypeScript. No lock-in.

### Why we built this:
We challenged ourselves to ship 4 AI products in 4 days using only AI agents. But orchestrating agents required too much boilerplate. So we built AgentForge — and used it to build itself. Very meta.

### Who is this for?
- **Founders** who want to automate customer support, marketing, ops
- **Indie hackers** building AI-powered SaaS
- **Agencies** deploying custom automation for clients
- **Non-technical teams** who need agents without hiring ML engineers

### Pricing:
🆓 **Free tier**: 100 agent runs/month  
💳 **Pay-as-you-go**: $0.10/run (includes LLM costs + orchestration)  
🔑 **BYOK option**: Bring your own API keys, pay only for hosting

## First Comment (Maker's Comment on Launch Day)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Erik, founder of Miyamoto Labs in Oslo. Super excited to share AgentForge with you today!

**The origin story:**

Three weeks ago, I gave myself a challenge: Build 4 real products in 4 days using only AI agents.

I started building specialized agents for design, coding, deployment, QA... but spent more time writing orchestration code than actual product features. That's when I realized: *the agent builder itself should be the product.*

So I built AgentForge — a visual, no-code way to create multi-agent systems. Then I used it to refactor its own codebase. (Yes, it built itself. Very Skynet, I know. 😅)

**What makes it different from other agent builders:**

I've tried Flowise, Langflow, n8n, Make, Relevance AI... they're all great, but:
- **Flowise/Langflow**: Too technical. You need to understand RAG, embeddings, vector DBs.
- **n8n/Make**: Built for workflows, not agents. No memory or reasoning loops.
- **Relevance AI**: Powerful, but steep learning curve.

AgentForge is **simple enough for a non-technical founder, powerful enough for real production use.**

**What I'd love feedback on:**

1. **Templates**: Which agent use cases should we add next?
2. **Pricing**: Is $0.10/run fair? (Includes LLM costs + orchestration + storage)
3. **Export**: Should we let you self-host the agent runtime?

**Try it free:** https://agent-builder-gamma.vercel.app  
No credit card required. 5-minute quickstart tutorial on the homepage.

Drop your questions below — I'll be here all day answering! 🚀

## Maker Comment (Response to Common Questions)

**Q: How is this different from AutoGPT or GPT-Engineer?**  
Great question! AutoGPT is fully autonomous (you give it a goal, it figures out the steps). AgentForge is *semi-autonomous* — you design the workflow, the agent executes it. This gives you control over what the agent can/can't do. Think of it like the difference between hiring a freelancer (AutoGPT) vs. building an internal tool (AgentForge).

**Q: Can I connect my own tools/APIs?**  
Yes! You can add custom API nodes, webhook nodes, database queries, web scraping, and even custom Python functions. If you can call it from code, you can add it to AgentForge.

**Q: What LLMs are supported?**  
GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus, DeepSeek, Gemini Pro. You can BYOK (bring your own keys) or use ours with pay-as-you-go pricing.

**Q: What happens if an agent fails mid-execution?**  
We have automatic retry logic with exponential backoff. You can also set up fallback nodes (if this fails, do that). All execution logs are saved, so you can debug exactly where it broke.

**Q: Is there a self-hosting option?**  
Not yet, but it's on the roadmap! If you need it, let me know — we're prioritizing features based on demand.
