# I made a no-code AI agent builder — design visually, get real deployable code

Hey r/nocode! 👋

I built **AgentForge** to let you build AI agents without writing code — but unlike other no-code tools, you get actual deployable code at the end (Python, Docker, everything you need).

**Why this matters:**
- Most no-code AI tools lock you into their platform
- When you hit limits or need custom features, you're stuck
- With AgentForge, you can hand the exported code to a developer and they can extend it

**How it works:**
1. Pick a template (customer support, data analyst, research assistant, etc.)
2. Drag-and-drop tools onto a canvas (web search, email, databases, APIs)
3. Configure behavior in plain English
4. Export → get Python code, Docker config, deployment instructions

**Real example: Build a customer support bot in 5 minutes**
- Start with "Customer Support" template
- Add tools: search knowledge base, create ticket, send email
- Set personality: "Professional but friendly, keep responses under 100 words"
- Export and deploy

**Free tier includes:**
- All templates
- Basic tool library
- 3 agent exports per month
- Community support

**Pro ($29/mo):**
- Unlimited exports
- Custom tool creation
- Priority support
- API access

**What I learned building this:**
People don't actually want "no-code" — they want "no setup." They're fine clicking around a UI, but they hate config files, environment variables, and debugging. So I made the builder generate all of that automatically.

**The honest pitch:** If you've wanted to build an AI agent but got intimidated by the code, this is for you. If you already know Python, you'll probably just write it yourself (and that's fine).

**Question for the community:** What's your biggest blocker when trying to build with AI? Is it the code, or figuring out how to even structure an agent?
