## Final Notes

**The goal isn't just signups — it's building a community.**

People who find us through Reddit, Discord, and Twitter will:
- Give better feedback (they care)
- Become advocates (they have skin in the game)
- Stick around longer (community > ads)

Treat every community interaction as a long-term relationship, not a transaction.

**Let's ship. 🚀**
