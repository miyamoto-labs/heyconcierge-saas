## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

1. **The Polymarket bot was WRONG** - It was doing momentum betting, not arbitrage. The real edge is exploiting Chainlink oracle lag vs Binance real-time prices.

2. **Learning layers are the differentiator** - A bot that adapts is worth 100x a static bot. Both bots now have adaptive learning.

3. **Ship fast, fix later** - We launched TrustClaw with a working waitlist before the full backend. Momentum > perfection.

4. **Sub-agents are force multipliers** - Spawned 5 Opus agents tonight working in parallel. Would have taken days manually.

## 🎯 TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES

1. [ ] Check Polymarket arbitrage bot performance
2. [ ] Register trustclaw.ai domain
3. [ ] Add WalletConnect project ID
4. [ ] First skill submission to TrustClaw
5. [ ] Monitor both bots' learning data

### Erik's Final Words
> "I wonder what Miyamoto Labs looks like in three weeks. We need to make financial freedom happen."

**Marketing ideas to explore:**
1. Launch thread in OpenClaw Discord
2. DM skill publishers directly (offer free verification)
3. Create first verified skills ourselves
4. "How we built TrustClaw in one night" build-in-public thread
