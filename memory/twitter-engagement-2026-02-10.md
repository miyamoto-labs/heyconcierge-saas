- **Text:** "Executing DeFi actions is table stakes. The hard part is knowing WHEN to execute and when to abstain. An agent that can't say 'no' to a bad trade is just expensive automation. Intelligence is discretion."

- **Text:** "The deeper insight: crypto doesn't just give agents wallets—it gives them SKIN IN THE GAME. An AI that can lose value makes different decisions than one that can't. Economic consequence is the bridge from automation to agency."
- **Theme:** Economic accountability
