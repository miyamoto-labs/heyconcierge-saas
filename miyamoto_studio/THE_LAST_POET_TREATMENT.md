## 1. LOGLINE

A son traces the outline of a father he barely knew — a struggling poet who vanished, was destroyed by cancer, and spent his final years writing alone in the Norwegian wilderness, never published, never heard.

---

## 2. TONE & STYLE

**Raw. Quiet. Aching.**

This is not a tragedy performed. It's a tragedy remembered — in fragments, the way memory actually works. Scenes bleed into each other. Time jumps without warning. A child's perspective shifts into an adult's mid-sentence.

Think: the painted texture of *Loving Vincent* meeting the fractured memory-architecture of *Waltz with Bashir*. Rotoscope animation over real Norwegian landscapes — forests, hospitals, small-town streets — so the world feels both real and slightly unstable, the way the past feels when you try to hold it.

The father is never sentimentalized. He is shown with Dostoyevskian compassion: a man who failed at much, who was broken by life, but who kept writing. That persistence — writing poems no one would read, walking into the forest with his dog, barely surviving — is treated not as pathetic but as sacred.

The stepfather's violence is present but never lingered on. It exists the way it exists in memory — sudden, loud, then a cut to silence. The film doesn't exploit it. It acknowledges it and moves on, the way children learn to.

## 3. THREE-ACT STRUCTURE

### ACT ONE — THE SMALL TOWN (0:00–5:00)

*A family trying to start over.*

We open on a small Norwegian town. A family of four. The father smokes, writes at a kitchen table. The mother moves through the house. Two small children. There is love here, but it's strained — thin, like ice in early spring.

The narrator (the son, adult voice, looking back) speaks sparingly. He doesn't explain. He describes what he sees in his memory: his father's hands, tobacco-stained. Paper everywhere. The sound of a pen.

Then — absence. The father is simply gone. No dramatic exit. One day the chair is empty. The pen is still on the table.

The son is four years old.

### ACT TWO — THE DARKNESS AND THE HOSPITAL (5:00–13:00)

*What filled the space the father left.*

The mother finds another man. The animation style shifts — harder lines, darker palette. The violence is rendered not graphically but through sound and motion: a door slamming, a child's perspective looking up, the impact felt more than seen. We see the mother holding the youngest child while being hit. The son watches. He is small. He can do nothing.

**Time jump.** They've moved to the city — the same city the father disappeared to.

The son is thirteen. He learns his father has cancer. A 15-hour surgery. They've removed half his tongue, his salivary glands.

**THE HOSPITAL SCENE:**

The son walks through a hospital corridor. He asks at a desk for his father's room. He's given a number. He walks. He finds the door. He opens it.

He steps inside.

He turns around and walks out.

He didn't recognize the man in the bed.

*This scene is held in near-silence. The animation slows. Every detail — the fluorescent light, the linoleum, the boy's hand on the door handle — is rendered with painful clarity. We never see the father's face in this moment. We see only the son's back as he turns away.*

### ACT THREE — THE LAST POET (13:00–18:00)

*A man alone with his words.*

The father survived. But he is, in the son's words, "half a man." His face is changed. His voice is changed. He is not who he was.

He writes. Dark poetry — between life and death. He tries to get published. He gives up.

He moves to the countryside. The animation opens up — wide landscapes, forest, light through birch trees. A small house. A dog. The father walks forest paths, sits at a desk, writes. He barely gets by.

The visual style here becomes its most beautiful — hand-painted, luminous, almost reverent. Because this is the spiritual heart: a man no one is listening to, still speaking. Still putting words on paper. Walking into the forest each day with his dog as if the trees might hear what the world wouldn't.

The narrator's voice is spare. He does not say "my father was brave" or "my father suffered." He simply describes: *He walked. He wrote. He lived like that until he didn't.*

## 4. THE CENTRAL THEME

**What it means to speak when no one is listening.**

This is a film about a poet who was never published, a father who was never fully present, a man who was physically unmade by disease — and who kept writing anyway. It asks: *Does a voice matter if no one hears it?*

The answer the film offers, quietly, without insisting: *Yes.*

It is also about the son's act of making this film — of finally hearing his father's words, of turning back to the hospital room he once fled, of looking this time.

## 5. KEY CINEMATIC MOMENTS

**1. The Kitchen Table**
The father writing, tobacco smoke rising. The son (age 4) watching from across the room. The father doesn't look up. Paper and pen. This is the first image and the last.

**2. The Empty Chair**
The father is gone. No explanation. The chair. The table. The pen left behind. The son's small hand touching the edge of the table.

**3. The Violence (Fragmented)**
Not a scene — a series of cuts. A door. A sound. The mother holding the baby brother. Looking up at a man's silhouette. Then silence. Then a different room, a different day, as if nothing happened. Because that's how it was.

**4. The Hospital Corridor**
The longest single sequence in the film. The walk. The door. The turn. The boy's back retreating. No music. Only footsteps and fluorescent hum.

**5. The Forest**
The father — older now, changed, diminished — walking a forest path with his dog. Light through the trees. He stops. He looks at something we can't see. He keeps walking. This scene repeats, varied slightly, like a ritual.

**6. The Desk in the Countryside**
The father's hand writing. We see fragments of his poetry — dark, honest lines. The pen moves. The words appear on screen, handwritten, as if the film itself is one of his poems.

## 6. VISUAL STYLE NOTES

- **Rotoscope animation** over live-action footage of real Norwegian locations — forests, small towns, hospital corridors. The technique creates a layer of remove, the way memory softens and distorts reality.
- **Three distinct palettes:**
  - *Small town / early childhood:* Muted warmth. Yellowed light. Tobacco tones.
  - *The stepfather years:* Cold. Hard lines. Shadows that swallow the frame.
  - *The countryside / the last poet:* Open. Birch-white and forest green. Hand-painted textures. The most beautiful the film gets.
- **The father's poems** appear as handwritten text on screen — his actual handwriting if available, or a close approximation. They bleed into the image like ink into water.
- **Faces are rarely fully shown.** The father is seen in profile, from behind, in fragments. The son is a presence more than a face. This is a film about people you can't quite hold onto.

---

## 7. SOUND & MUSIC

- **Minimal score.** A solo instrument — piano, or a single bowed string — used sparingly. Silence is the primary texture.
- **Ambient sound carries the film:** Wind through trees. A pen on paper. Footsteps on linoleum. A dog's breath. A door closing.
- **The violence is conveyed through sound, not image:** A sudden sharp noise, then nothing. The contrast is what makes it unbearable.
- **The narrator's voice** is calm, unhurried. Not performed. The way you'd tell someone this story late at night, looking at the floor. Norwegian, with the cadence of someone choosing each word carefully.
- **The father's poetry** may be heard in a different voice — or in the father's own damaged voice, if the film dares that. Slurred, difficult, but present.
- **Reference composers:** Ólafur Arnalds, Nils Frahm, the quieter passages of Arvo Pärt. But less is more. The forest has its own music.

## 8. THE ENDING

Three options:

### Option A — The Poems
The son, now an adult, sits with a stack of his father's unpublished poems. He reads one aloud. We hear the words over images of the forest, the dog, the empty desk. The poem ends. Silence. Black. *The film becomes the publication the father never had.*

### Option B — The Return
The son walks the same forest path his father walked. Same trees, same light. He stops where his father used to stop. He stands there. He doesn't speak. The camera holds. Then he keeps walking. *The cycle continues, but witnessed now.*

### Option C — The Door
We return to the hospital corridor. The boy walks. Reaches the door. Opens it. This time, he doesn't turn around. He steps inside. We never see what he sees. But he stays. The screen goes to white — not black. *He finally looks.*

## 9. FILM FESTIVAL POSITIONING

### Primary Targets
- **Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival** (France) — The world's largest short film festival. European arthouse animation fits perfectly.
- **Annecy International Animation Film Festival** (France) — Premier animation festival. The rotoscope/mixed media approach is ideal for their programming.
- **Bergen International Film Festival** (Norway) — Home territory. Norwegian story, Norwegian landscape.
- **Nordisk Panorama** (Scandinavia) — Nordic documentary and short film festival.

### Secondary Targets
- **Sundance Film Festival** — Short Film / Animation category
- **Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF)** — Short Cuts programme
- **Locarno Film Festival** — Pardi di domani (Leopards of Tomorrow) shorts competition
- **Tampere Film Festival** (Finland) — One of Europe's oldest short film festivals
- **DOK Leipzig** — If positioned as animated documentary

### Category
**Animated Short Film** or **Short Film** depending on festival structure. The rotoscope technique qualifies for animation categories, which often have less competition and more visibility.

### Awards Positioning
- **Academy Awards (Oscars)** — Qualifying through a festival win (Clermont-Ferrand, TIFF, etc.) for Best Animated Short Film
- **European Film Awards** — Short Film category
- **Amanda Awards** (Norwegian Film Awards) — Best Short Film

### Pitch Angle
*An animated memoir about an unpublished Norwegian poet — told by his son, who once walked into a hospital room and didn't recognize his own father. Made in the tradition of Loving Vincent and Waltz with Bashir, THE LAST POET asks what it means to create when no one is listening.*
