## YouTube Shorts Optimization

### Key Settings
- **Upload as Short** (under 60 seconds, 9:16 aspect ratio)
- **First 3 seconds = hook** (most critical for retention)
- **Loop-friendly endings** (last frame connects to first)
- **Add music** from YouTube's library OR our own AI-generated soundtrack
- **Hashtags in title:** #Shorts #AIAnime #Cyberpunk

### Posting Schedule
- **3-5 Shorts per week** (algorithm rewards consistency)
- **Best times for global audience:** 
  - 2 PM - 4 PM UTC (catches US morning + EU afternoon)
  - 7 PM - 9 PM UTC (US afternoon + EU evening)
- **Cross-post to Twitter** same day

### Growth Tactics
1. **First 48 hours matter most** — share everywhere on upload
2. **Engage with comments** within first hour
3. **Use trending sounds/music** when relevant
4. **Create series** (episodes build anticipation)
5. **End screens + cards** pointing to other videos
6. **Community tab** for behind-the-scenes teasers

## Content Pipeline

### Episode Format (30-60s Shorts)
1. Opening hook (0-3s) — dramatic visual + sound
2. Narration + scenes (3-50s) — story unfolds
3. Closing beat (last 5s) — title card + subscribe CTA

### Series Plan
- **Season 1: "Signals from 2089"** — 10 episodes, standalone vignettes
- **The Last Poet** — Longer format trailer + eventual full short film
- **Behind the Machine** — Process videos (how AI makes anime)

### Production Cost Per Episode
- 4-6 frames @ $0.16 = $0.64-0.96
- Narration (ElevenLabs) = ~$0.05
- Music (if AI-generated) = ~$0.10
- **Total: ~$1 per episode**
