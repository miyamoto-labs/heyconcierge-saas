## VC Thesis

### Capital Intensity Era
- AI investment entering "mature phase characterized by capital-intensive competition among a handful of global players"
- VCs shifting from "potential returns" talk to understanding macroeconomic context, investment thesis, impact, and rationale
- Corporate VC forecasts: $28B+ in 2026 (up from 22% of global VC, previously 15-20% in early 2025) driven by M&A acceleration

### Emerging Categories VCs Are Mapping
- **AI Infrastructure & Compute**: Dominant theme - data centers, chips, training infrastructure
- **Vertical AI Solutions**: Legal (Anthropic's Cowork, Lawhive), accounting (Accrual), credit analysis (EnFi), regulated labs (Expert Intelligence)
- **AI Research & Interpretability**: Goodfire ($150M at $1.25B valuation) - understanding AI model internals
- **Adaptive/Efficient Models**: Focus on cheaper AI systems using less compute power (Adaption Labs thesis)
- **Novel AI Applications**: Scent design (Osmo), voice synthesis (ElevenLabs)

### Key Investment Signals
- **Bain Capital Ventures**: Launched "Cafe Compute" co-hosted with Cerebras - late-night hangout for founders/developers/researchers to trade ideas
- **Validation of multimodal bets**: Black Forest Labs raised $300M Series B at $3.25B valuation
- **Enterprise AI focus**: Anthropic holds "plurality of enterprise market" per Menlo Ventures report

## New Products

### Foundation Model Releases
- **Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6** (Feb 5): Better at coding, sustained tasks, higher-quality professional work - "inflection point for knowledge work"
  - Capabilities: Financial research, legal analysis (Cowork tool), zero-day vulnerability detection
  - Market impact: Software stocks dropped on launch - "Wall Street panicked"
- **OpenAI Frontier** (Feb 5): Enterprise platform to build/deploy/manage AI agents "like human employees"

### Enterprise AI Tools
- **Anthropic Cowork expansions**: Legal tools (open-source), sales automation, customer support
  - Note: "AI-generated analysis should be reviewed by licensed attorneys"
- **Amazon Alexa+**: AI-upgraded assistant now available to everyone in U.S. (exited "early access" preview)

### Hardware Signals
- **Apple (Tim Cook)**: "New categories of products and services enabled through AI" - hinting at AI devices beyond iPhone tap/swipe paradigm
- **Image-to-Video AI tools**: Practical playbooks emerging for product launches (fast, cost-effective)

## Signals

### 🔥 White Hot
1. **Foundation model consolidation**: Anthropic doubling funding target ($20B), xAI raising $20B - "handful of global players" dominating
2. **Enterprise vertical disruption**: AI tools directly threatening legacy software (Thomson Reuters, Pearson stock reactions to Anthropic legal tools)
3. **AI infrastructure arms race**: $650B Big Tech capex for 2026 data centers - unprecedented scale
4. **Chip wars intensifying**: Cerebras ($1B), Positron ($230M from Arm/Qatar) challenging Nvidia

### 📈 Rising Momentum
1. **AI interpretability investment**: Goodfire $150M round signals importance of understanding black boxes
2. **Voice/multimodal**: ElevenLabs $11B valuation, IPO prep - voice interfaces going mainstream
3. **Agent platforms**: OpenAI Frontier launch shows enterprise orchestration layer emerging
4. **Efficient AI thesis**: Adaption Labs $50M seed on "cheaper AI, less compute" resonating with VCs

### ⚠️ Risk Indicators
1. **Software replacement anxiety**: Traditional B2B SaaS stocks reacting negatively to AI native tools
2. **Capital concentration**: 74% of funding to mega rounds - smaller rounds getting squeezed
3. **Valuation stretching**: $350B for Anthropic, $11B for ElevenLabs pre-IPO - expectations extremely high
4. **Infrastructure dependency**: $650B capex shows how capital-intensive AI leadership has become

### 💡 Emerging Opportunities
1. **Vertical AI solutions**: Legal, accounting, credit analysis seeing strong funding - more niches exist
2. **AI + physical world**: Osmo (scent), robotics mentions suggest underexplored embodied AI
3. **Enterprise agent tooling**: OpenAI Frontier just launched - ecosystem tooling layer wide open
4. **Cost optimization**: Counter-trend to capital intensity - efficient models, novel architectures (Adaption Labs thesis)
