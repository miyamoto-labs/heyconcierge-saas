## Signals

### 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **2026 Declared "Year of Agents"** - Multiple creators independently converging on this narrative. Skeptics are changing their minds (Dan Sanchez: "I've mocked AI agents for 2 years. January 2026 changed my mind.")

2. **OpenClaw Breakout Moment** - 6+ videos in past week covering OpenClaw for trading, coding, automation. This is crossing into mainstream AI creator attention.

3. **Crypto×AI Power Thesis** - Narrative shifting from "AI tokens" to infrastructure reality: data centers, compute power, autonomous trading systems. "All boils down to power."

4. **Security Becoming Front-of-Mind** - "AI Agent Skills are a New Malware Supply Chain Risk" (5 days ago). As agents gain capabilities, attack surface discussions emerging.

5. **Self-Hosted Movement** - "Build 100% Self-Hosted AI Agents" gaining traction as privacy/control concerns grow.

6. **From Theory to Practice** - Shift from "what are AI agents?" to "here's how to build/deploy them". Practical tutorials dominating over conceptual explainers.

7. **Google/Enterprise Catching Up** - Gemini Agent Mode, watsonx security focus. Big tech racing to productize agentic AI.

8. **Solo Builder Content Gap** - Less solo founder storytelling than expected. Most content is tool tutorials & infrastructure. **Opportunity: authentic solo builder narrative content is underserved.**

### 📊 Content Strategy Implications

- **OpenClaw trading content is HOT** - 6 days old, already getting tutorial coverage
- **Security angle** - Early but growing (malware supply chain risk)
- **Power/infrastructure thesis** - Resonating with crypto audience ("it all boils down to power")
- **Autonomous execution > chatbots** - Clear positioning differentiation

### 🚨 Watch List

- OpenClaw creator ecosystem velocity (new videos daily)
