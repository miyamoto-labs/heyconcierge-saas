# Daily Intelligence Report — February 10, 2026

## 🔥 Top 3 Opportunities

### 1. **Polymarket Bot-as-a-Service (High-Priority)**
Someone's **$500K/month Polymarket bot** is making waves (11,420 predictions, 380 trades/day). Market is HUNGRY for plug-and-play automated trading solutions. Our EasyPoly positions us perfectly here — but we need to:
- Add more sophisticated strategies (the winner uses arbitrage + technical analysis combos)
- Offer white-label versions for crypto Twitter influencers
- Build "copy-trading" feature (users follow top-performing bots)

**Action:** Study the successful bot patterns. Reddit reports pros aim for 62-68% win rate with 1:1.2 R/R, or 45-50% with 1:3+ reward ratios. CLOB latency arbitrage windows are sub-500ms.

### 2. **AI Founder-as-a-Service Platform**
Feltsense just raised **$5.1M** for AI agents that act as autonomous founders — they source ideas, build products, go to market, and hire humans for "Real World Boundaries" (payments, legal, etc.). Quote: *"Human founders are no longer an accelerant. They're the bottleneck."*

**Miyamoto Labs angle:** We already have AgentForge (agent builder) + bot infrastructure. Package it as "Founder Agent Studio" — spin up autonomous product companies, let them compete for market share, take a cut of revenue.

### 3. **Agent Security Consulting**
With ai.com's mainstream push and agent adoption exploding, **prompt injection attacks** are the new SQL injection. "Agent Arena" launched to test manipulation-proof agents. Security-conscious enterprises will pay BIG for hardened agent deployments.

**TrustClaw pivot:** Add "Security Audit" tier — test skills/agents for prompt injection, data leakage, auth bypass. Charge $500-2K per audit.

## 📊 Market Sentiment

**BULLISH AS HELL.** The ai.com launch (Crypto.com founder, $70M domain, Super Bowl ad) signals mainstream consumer AI agent arrival. Platform offers autonomous agents for stock trading, calendar management, workflow automation — targeting non-technical users.

Key quote from Kris Marszalek: *"We are at a fundamental shift in AI's evolution as we rapidly move beyond basic chats to AI agents actually getting things done for humans."*

Sentiment across crypto Twitter, HN, Reddit: 
- **Excitement** about autonomous trading/DeFi agents (Ethereum L2s getting heavy usage)
- **Skepticism** about AI coding agents (debate: "it doesn't compile" vs "it shipped in 2 hours")
- **FOMO** around agent infrastructure plays (everyone wants to be the "Shopify for AI agents")

Microsoft pushing "agentic commerce" as the new retail front door. Enterprise adoption accelerating.
