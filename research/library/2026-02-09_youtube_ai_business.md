## Key Business Strategies Extracted

### 1. **The Decoy Offer Strategy** (21:55)
A loss-leader approach to get clients in the door:
- Offer something free or extremely low-cost initially
- Use it as a foot-in-the-door to demonstrate value
- Upsell to higher-value services after proving ROI

**Miyamoto Labs Application:**
- Could offer free AI audit or free trial period for EasyPoly
- Free website widget (AI chat assistant) → upsell to full automation suite
- Free AI agent consultation → sell AgentForge subscription

### 2. **Free Website Method** (25:25)
Lead generation through value-first positioning:
- Build free tools/resources that attract target customers
- Capture leads through free offering
- Convert with paid premium features

**Miyamoto Labs Application:**
- Create free AI tools/demos on landing page
- Free TrustClaw skill browsing → paid skill downloads
- Free AgentForge tier → paid enterprise tier

### 3. **Niche Selection Framework** (14:30)
Choosing profitable niches:
- Look for industries with repetitive workflows
- Target businesses with budget for automation
- Focus on measurable ROI (time saved, revenue increased)

**Miyamoto Labs Application:**
- **Current niches:** Crypto trading (EasyPoly), content creation (Miyamoto Studio)
- **Potential expansion:** E-commerce automation, customer service automation, sales automation
- Double down on crypto/DeFi niche where we have expertise

### 4. **Scalable Offer Design** (01:02:17)
Productizing services to avoid custom work:
- Create repeatable solutions instead of one-offs
- Package AI agents as products, not services
- Use templates and workflows

**Miyamoto Labs Application:**
- ✅ Already doing this with EasyPoly (packaged bot)
- ✅ TrustClaw enables selling packaged "skills"
- ✅ AgentForge is the platform play
- Need: More pre-built agent templates/use cases

### 5. **Outreach Hacks** (01:53:09)
Advanced prospecting strategies:
- Personalized video outreach
- Multi-channel approach (email + LinkedIn + phone)
- Value-first messaging (free audit, insights)

**Miyamoto Labs Application:**
- Create personalized video demos using Miyamoto Studio
- Multi-channel outreach: Twitter DMs, email (AgentMail), LinkedIn
- Lead with free value: "I analyzed your workflow and found 3 automation opportunities"

### 6. **Sales Training** (02:15:40)
30-minute dedicated sales training section:
- Handling objections
- Pricing strategy
- Closing techniques
- Demo structure

**Critical for Miyamoto Labs:** We have the tech but need sales process.

### 7. **Upselling Framework** (02:56:05)
Revenue expansion from existing clients:
- Start small, expand based on results
- Tier pricing (basic → pro → enterprise)
- Add-on services

**Miyamoto Labs Application:**
- EasyPoly: Free trial → Basic ($49/mo) → Pro ($199/mo) → Enterprise (custom)
- Cross-sell between products: EasyPoly users → Miyamoto Studio for content
- Monthly retainer model for ongoing support

### 8. **Referral System** (02:58:31)
Viral growth mechanics:
- Incentivize existing clients to refer
- Make referrals easy (templates, one-click sharing)
- Offer rewards (discounts, commissions, free months)

**Miyamoto Labs Application:**
- TrustClaw already has built-in viral loop (skill marketplace)
- Add referral program to EasyPoly: "Refer a friend, get 1 month free"
- Affiliate program for content creators promoting our tools

## Business Model Insights

### Revenue Models Discussed
1. **Monthly retainers** - Ongoing automation services ($1k-$10k/mo)
2. **Project-based** - One-time automation builds ($5k-$50k)
3. **Performance-based** - % of cost savings or revenue generated
4. **SaaS model** - Productized AI agents (appears to be the direction promoted)

### Pricing Strategy
- Don't compete on price, compete on value
- Show ROI clearly (time saved, revenue increase)
- Tier pricing to capture different customer segments

**Miyamoto Labs Current Position:**
