- **Example:** Run experiments for $100/month that cost them $50K/month

#### **3. 24/7 AUTONOMOUS OPERATION**
- **Their constraint:** Human work hours, timezones, vacations
- **Our advantage:** AI agents work 24/7, never sleep
- **Example:** ORACLE-1 trading 24/7, PROPHET monitoring markets

#### **4. CRYPTO-NATIVE BY DEFAULT**
- **Their constraint:** TradFi mindset, slow to adopt crypto
- **Our advantage:** Built on Hyperliquid, Polymarket, Bankr from day one
- **Example:** Launch a prediction market product integrated with Polymarket in 48 hours

#### **5. EXTREME NICHE FOCUS**
- **Their constraint:** Need revenue to support 50 people
- **Our advantage:** Can focus on ultra-niche markets profitably
- **Example:** AI for Hyperliquid traders—tiny market, but we can own it
