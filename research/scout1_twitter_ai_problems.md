## 🔴 TOP 10 UNSOLVED PROBLEMS AT HUMAN × AI INTERSECTION

### 1. **The Reliability Crisis**
**The Problem:** AI agents fail catastrophically in real-world enterprise scenarios. The APEX benchmark shows even the best models struggle to get >25% of white-collar work questions right. Reliability issues are the #1 barrier to enterprise adoption (306 practitioner survey, 2025).

**Why It Matters:** Gartner predicts 40% of agentic AI projects will be CANCELED by 2027 due to escalating costs, unclear business value, and inadequate risk controls. Companies are stuck in "pilot purgatory" — can demo, can't scale.

**What's Missing:** Boring engineering. Observability. Tracing. State management. Constrained blast radius. Everyone wants flashy demos; nobody's building the unglamorous infrastructure that makes agents actually work.

---

### 2. **The Integration Nightmare**
**The Problem:** Average enterprise manages **957 applications**, but only **27% are connected**. AI agents can't access the context they need because data is siloed across disconnected systems.

**Why It Matters:** 60% of enterprises cite legacy system integration and risk/compliance as their PRIMARY challenges in adopting agentic AI. The AI works fine in a sandbox; it breaks when you try to plug it into Oracle ERP from 2003.

**What's Missing:** Event-driven architecture. Smart connectors that don't break. API integrations that actually work. The problem isn't the LLM — it's the "brittle connectors" and "dumb RAG" (dumping everything into context without structure).

---

### 3. **The Trust Gap**
**The Problem:** People either blindly trust AI (automation bias) or don't trust it at all. Early evidence shows reliance on AI tools weakens critical thinking skills. Users treat ChatGPT like a therapist, turning over sensitive personal info without scrutiny.

**Why It Matters:** Without observability into how agents reason and act, teams can't debug failures, optimize performance, or build stakeholder trust. One lawsuit already underway: family of teen who died by suicide is suing OpenAI (trial Nov 2026).

**What's Missing:** Transparency. Explainability. Human-in-the-loop workflows. Trust is earned "one small workflow at a time," not by shipping black-box magic.

---

### 4. **The ROI Problem**
**The Problem:** Stanford AI experts predict 2026 will see "a lot of failed AI projects." Companies say AI hasn't shown productivity increases **except in programming and call centers**. Most agentic deployments in 2025 didn't deliver measurable value.

**Why It Matters:** Enterprises are done with "exploratory" AI investments. VCs predict companies will spend MORE on AI in 2026, but through FEWER vendors — they're picking winners and cutting the rest. If you can't prove ROI, you're out.

**What's Missing:** Vertical AI deeply integrated with workflows. Purpose-built agents for specific, measurable outcomes. Not "AI for everything" — AI for one thing, done exceptionally well.

---

### 5. **The Data Quality Crisis**
**The Problem:** "Garbage in, garbage out" at enterprise scale. Poor or outdated training data causes repeated failures. AI scrapes SEO-optimized dogshit from the internet and regurgitates it. Google search is now "a useless nightmare" (Reddit consensus).

**Why It Matters:** Data quality and context gaps are the silent killers of AI projects. If your agent can't tell the difference between a legitimate source and AI-generated spam, it's worse than useless.

**What's Missing:** Curated, vetted data sources. Context-aware retrieval. Human curation at scale. Data pipelines that filter noise.

---

### 6. **The Talent Shortage**
**The Problem:** Companies are desperately hunting for data scientists, ML engineers, prompt engineers, and "Chiefs of Staff for AI" — roles that **barely exist today**. Upskilling employees is framed as the main driver of long-term value, but most organizations have no clue how to do it.

**Why It Matters:** You can buy the best AI tools on the planet, but if nobody in your org knows how to use them, configure them, or integrate them, you're dead in the water.

**What's Missing:** Accessible education. Tools that non-technical people can actually use. "Democratization of AI agent creation" is a buzzword; the technical barriers are still massive.

---

### 7. **The Governance & Compliance Black Hole**
**The Problem:** Most CISOs express "deep concern" about AI agent risks, yet only a handful have implemented mature safeguards. Governance is the difference between scaling successfully and stalling out — but most companies delegate it to tech teams instead of involving senior leadership.

**Why It Matters:** AI agents represent the new **insider threat**. They have access to systems, credentials, and data. Without governance, you're handing the keys to an unpredictable black box.

**What's Missing:** Mature AI governance frameworks. Risk management tools. Liability and compliance clarity. Regulation is coming (EU AI Act, US proposals) but enforcement is murky.

---

### 8. **The Context Problem**
**The Problem:** AI agents struggle with **context that spans time, people, and systems**. They can answer a question in isolation, but they can't track a multi-step workflow across Slack, email, Salesforce, and Jira without losing the thread.

**Why It Matters:** Real work isn't single-step. It's "understand the objective, plan steps, call tools, verify results, report back." Agentic solutions break down into many steps — and **the overall solution is only accurate if you're accurate each step of the way** (AT&T chief data officer).

**What's Missing:** Multi-modal, persistent context management. Memory that survives across sessions. Workflow orchestration that actually works.

---

### 9. **The Human Interface Problem**
**The Problem:** Natural language UIs create an **unbounded set of possible inputs**. People type messy, ambiguous, contradictory instructions. AI tries to guess what they mean, often guesses wrong, and frustrates users.

**Why It Matters:** Non-technical users struggle to give AI the right prompts, context, and constraints. The "democratization" promise falls flat because most people don't think like prompt engineers.

**What's Missing:** Constrained interfaces that guide users toward success. Smart defaults. Error correction. "Did you mean this?" flows that catch misunderstandings early.

---

### 10. **The Loneliness Epidemic**
**The Problem:** AI companion apps have **tens of millions of users**, a small share of whom show patterns of increased loneliness and reduced social engagement. People use AI chatbots for emotional support, spiritual guidance, relationship counseling, intimacy — and become *more* isolated.

**Why It Matters:** This is a second-order effect nobody anticipated. AI as a substitute for human connection creates dependency, not empowerment.

**What's Missing:** AI that **augments** human relationships instead of replacing them. Tools that connect people, not isolate them.

## 🕳️ TOP 5 MARKET GAPS NOBODY IS FILLING

### 1. **Boring AI Infrastructure for Reliability**
**The Gap:** Everyone's building flashy agents. Nobody's building the unglamorous observability, tracing, and governance tools that make agents production-ready.

**Opportunity:** Build the Datadog for AI agents. Enterprise-grade monitoring, failure analysis, debugging. "Boring" is what scales in enterprise.

---

### 2. **Event-Driven Architecture for AI Systems**
**The Gap:** Most AI integrations rely on polling (inefficient, expensive). Nobody's solved the "brittle connector" problem at scale.

**Opportunity:** Build the Zapier for AI agents — but with event-driven triggers, smart retries, and context preservation. Sell to enterprises stuck in integration hell.

---

### 3. **Vertical AI for SMBs**
**The Gap:** All the AI tools are built for enterprises with budgets, data scientists, and IT teams. Small businesses are ignored.

**Opportunity:** Build vertical AI for **one industry** (dentists, law firms, HVAC companies) that works out-of-the-box. No prompt engineering required. Clear ROI in 90 days.

---

### 4. **Human-AI Collaboration Tools (Not Replacement)**
**The Gap:** Most AI tools assume the AI does the work and the human checks it. Reality: humans need to collaborate *with* AI, not just QA it.

**Opportunity:** Build tools for **paired workflows** — where AI handles grunt work, humans handle judgment, and handoffs are seamless. Think GitHub Copilot but for non-coders.

---

### 5. **AI Governance & Risk SaaS**
**The Gap:** CISOs know AI is a risk, but they don't have tools to manage it. Compliance is a mess. Liability is unclear.

**Opportunity:** Build governance-as-a-service. Audit trails, risk scoring, compliance checks, liability insurance integration. Sell to nervous CISOs.

## 🔥 YC 2026 REQUEST FOR STARTUPS: WHAT THEY WANT TO FUND

YC's Spring 2026 RFS is explicit: **"AI-native companies that replace entire workflows."**

Key themes:
- **Companies built with the assumption that agents, not humans, do most of the work**
- Systems thinking — operate within complexity, not avoid it
- AI as an operator: deciding what to build, guiding human work, moving capital, uncovering fraud
- Reasoning about the physical world (robotics, embodied AI)

**Translation:** YC doesn't want "AI features." They want **workflow replacements**. If you can't replace 80% of a job/process with AI, they're not interested.

## 🎯 SYNTHESIS: WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY IS

### **The Pattern:**
1. **Hype is colliding with reality.** AI agents work in demos, fail in production.
2. **Enterprises are desperate** for boring, reliable infrastructure — not flashy features.
3. **Integration is the bottleneck**, not the LLM.
4. **Vertical beats horizontal.** Purpose-built agents for specific industries are winning.
5. **Small teams can compete** by solving **one problem exceptionally well** instead of trying to "boil the ocean."

### **The Sweet Spot for Miyamoto Labs:**
- **Build boring infrastructure** (observability, governance, integration) that enterprises will pay for
- **Build vertical AI** for one underserved industry (healthcare billing, legal ops, etc.)
- **Build human × AI collaboration tools** that reduce friction instead of replacing humans
- **Go after SMBs** that are ignored by enterprise-focused AI vendors
- **Leverage open-source models** (DeepSeek, Llama) to undercut expensive closed models

### **The 6-Month Play:**
Pick ONE of the Tier 1 opportunities above. Build MVP in 4-6 weeks. Get 5 paying customers by month 3. Hit $10K MRR by month 6. Use agent labor (not human labor) to scale faster than competitors.

## 📝 FINAL TAKEAWAY

**The biggest unsolved problem at the human × AI intersection isn't technical — it's operational.**

The LLMs work. The problem is:
- **Integration** (apps don't talk to each other)
- **Reliability** (agents fail in production)
- **Trust** (people don't know when to trust AI)
- **ROI** (companies can't prove value)
- **Governance** (nobody knows who's liable)

**If you solve any ONE of these problems for a specific vertical, you have a $10M+ ARR business in 18 months.**

The AI gold rush is over. The **AI infrastructure rush** is just beginning.
