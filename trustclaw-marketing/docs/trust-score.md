# Understanding the Trust Score

TrustClaw’s trust score is a dynamic metric that evaluates the security and reliability of AI agent skills. Here’s how it works:

## Components of the Trust Score
1. **Code Review**: Static and dynamic analysis of the skill’s code for vulnerabilities.
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitoring runtime behavior for anomalies.
3. **User Feedback**: Aggregated ratings and reports from users.
4. **Update Frequency**: Regular updates indicate active maintenance.

## Scoring Scale
- **90-100**: Highly trusted, minimal risk.
- **70-89**: Trusted with minor caveats.
- **50-69**: Use with caution.
- **Below 50**: Not recommended.

## How It Helps You
- **Transparency**: Clear metrics to assess risk.
- **Confidence**: Run skills knowing their trustworthiness.
