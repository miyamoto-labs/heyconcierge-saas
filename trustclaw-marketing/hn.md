Show HN: TrustClaw - Security Verification for AI Agent Skills

We built TrustClaw to solve a critical gap in the AI agent ecosystem - skill security. Unlike traditional apps, AI agents execute dynamic code with system access, creating new attack surfaces.

TrustClaw analyzes and monitors skills to:
- Detect credential theft attempts
- Prevent shell command injection
- Stop data exfiltration

Key technical differentiators:
1. Hybrid static+dynamic analysis
2. Runtime behavior profiling
3. Automatic skill revocation
4. Portable verification certificates

Open to feedback from the HN community - especially on our verification approach and developer APIs.
