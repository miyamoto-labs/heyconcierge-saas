**Announcing TrustClaw: The Missing Layer for AI Agent Security**

As AI agents become workforce multipliers, security can't remain an afterthought. Today we're launching TrustClaw - the first security platform built specifically for AI agents and their skills.

**Why This Matters:**
- 63% of enterprises delay AI agent adoption due to security concerns (Gartner)
- Unverified skills pose supply chain risks to core systems
- Current platforms lack runtime protection and auditing

**Our Approach:**
TrustClaw introduces:
1. **Skill Verification** - Static + dynamic analysis
2. **Runtime Protection** - Behavior monitoring and containment
3. **Enterprise Controls** - Whitelisting, auditing, compliance

**For Developers:** Build trusted skills with our verification toolkit and marketplace.

**For Enterprises:** Deploy AI agents safely with SOC2-ready controls.
