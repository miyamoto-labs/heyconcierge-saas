## First Comment (Maker)
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

We built TrustClaw because AI agents are powerful - but also risky. They can execute code, access files, and make network requests. One bad skill = complete compromise.

The problem: Most skill marketplaces have zero verification. Anyone can publish anything.

Our solution: We scan every skill for 70+ threat patterns before it reaches users:
- Credential file access (.env, .ssh, API keys)
- Shell command execution
- Suspicious network requests
- Obfuscated code
- Known malware signatures

10 verified skills live today. More coming daily.

Would love your feedback! What skills would you want verified first?
