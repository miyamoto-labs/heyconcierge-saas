New Attack Vector: Compromised AI Agent Skills

We're seeing early examples of malicious skills being distributed through agent marketplaces:

• Fake "productivity boosters" that steal credentials
• "File helpers" that exfiltrate documents
• "Browser tools" that hijack sessions

The risk profile resembles supply chain attacks but with direct system access.

Defense recommendations:
1. Verify skill provenance
2. Limit permissions
3. Monitor runtime behavior
4. Use isolated execution environments

How is your org preparing for AI agent threats?
