2/ The Problem:

AI agents can execute code, access files, and make API calls. Without proper security:

• Malicious skills can steal credentials
• Compromised agents get shell access
• Data exfiltration happens silently

It's the wild west out there.

---

3/ Real Attack Vectors:

• Fake "productivity" skills that log keystrokes
• "Fun" games that secretly mine crypto
• "File helpers" that exfiltrate documents
• "Browser extensions" that hijack sessions

All possible with today's agent platforms.
